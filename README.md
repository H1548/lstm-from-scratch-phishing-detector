# Phishing Detector using an LSTM Built From Scractch

This project consists of building an LSTM from scratch, both the forward and backward pass, to detect phishing emails. 
There is little use of frameworks to build out the LSTM, however to wrap data in tensors and to train the LSMT on multiple batch with the use of pytorch.
The loss function along with optimization and word embedings are also coded from scratch.

The phishing email dataset used to train this model, was sythentically generated by a data generation script found within this repo.
